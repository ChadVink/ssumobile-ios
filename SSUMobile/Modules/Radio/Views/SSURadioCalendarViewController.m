    The purpose of this class is to allow the user to open a webview of the calendar on the radio,
    but not worry about hitting the nav bar Back button and getting sent back to the home screen.
    Therefore, a new viewcontroller was made solely for this webview that is loaded on startup, 
    allowing the user to go back to the radio when they wish.
